## Identifying problem areas through the given video classification module

1. We use the video classification module [code](https://github.com/cradle-uz/traffic_laws/blob/video_demo_classification/scripts/classificatsion_video_demo.py)
   
    We transferred the video to frames using the code and downloaded the corresponding pictures, the result and
    ðŸ‘‰ [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TyijJpv5I1dOFQlUJkKayGSAhYv015n4) uploaded to earth

2. convert the received videos into a video viewer [code](https://github.com/cradle-uz/traffic_laws/blob/video_demo_classification/scripts/frame_do_video.py)
  
    co and this ðŸ‘‰ [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lPyXneWOwdVV4Qq-eP9mFpMcaoo-McxF)
    loaded on the ground

The highest number of frames is 386 in `vid_39_1284-2_1293`

The minimum number of frames is 38 in `vid_39_1284-2_1202`

The most problem frames are 358 in `vid_39_1284-2_1293`

The least problem frames are 1 in `vid_39_1284-2_1174`

The most good frames are 116 in `vid_39_1284-2_1174`

The least good frames are 9 in `vid_39_1284-2_1237`

Some errors were also detected, they were considered problems in the video, but these are good examples

The module is basically starting before or after the violation, not exactly on the line
